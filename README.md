Upload dithered screenshots of movies to ~~instagram~~. The instagram API is pretty locked down now. Time for a new plan??

Most of this code is from https://github.com/TomWhitwell/SlowMovie but I've adapted it to upload photos ~~to Instagram~~.

Where to upload now... hmm.

## Usage

1. create virtualenv and install dependencies
2. Add `.mp4` videos to the `Videos/` folder
3. Run script, images are output to `Images/`

## What does this do?

Not a whole lot. I wanted to upload these daily to instagram, but the API is more locked down now.

Check out [this branch](https://github.com/nickbytes/slowdrive-in/tree/applescript), which saves the output image as your background (macOS).
